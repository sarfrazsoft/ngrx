Here's a comprehensive list of NGRX terms extracted from your lesson plan, along with additional terms where necessary. I will define these terms in detail with code examples where relevant:

1. **Redux Architecture**:
   - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications.

2. **Introduction on State Management**:
   - State management is the process of managing the data that represents the state of your application.

3. **Redux: Three Principles**:
   - The three core principles of Redux are:
     - Single source of truth.
     - State is read-only.
     - Changes are made with pure functions.

4. **Redux: Core Concepts**:
   - Core concepts in Redux include store, actions, reducers, and middleware.

5. **Immutable and Mutable JavaScript**:
   - Immutable data cannot be changed once created, while mutable data can be changed.
   - In Redux, state should be immutable.

6. **Writing our own Redux Store**:
   - Creating a custom Redux store from scratch.

7. **Store creation and initial State**:
   - Creating a Redux store and defining its initial state.
   ```javascript
   const initialState = {
     // Define your initial state properties here
   };
   const store = createStore(reducer, initialState);
   ```

8. **Dispatching Actions**:
   - Dispatching actions is how you notify the store that something has happened in your application.
   ```javascript
   store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
   ```

9. **All about Reducers**:
   - Reducers are pure functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.

10. **Store Subscriptions**:
    - Subscribing to changes in the Redux store.
    ```javascript
    store.subscribe(() => {
      // Handle state changes here
    });
    ```

11. **Actions to Action Creators**:
    - Action creators are functions that create actions.
    ```javascript
    const increment = (amount) => ({
      type: 'INCREMENT',
      payload: amount,
    });
    ```

12. **Architecture: ngrx/store and components**:
    - The architecture of ngrx/store and its integration with components.

13. **High level ngrx/store**:
    - An overview of ngrx/store's functionality.

14. **Reactive component architecture**:
    - Building components in a reactive way using ngrx.

15. **Core Essentials**:
    - The fundamental concepts and components of NGRX.

16. **Action Constants and Creators**:
    - Constants and functions for creating actions.

17. **Creating and Registering our Reducer**:
    - Defining and registering reducers in the store.

18. **State composition with Selectors**:
    - Selectors are functions that retrieve specific pieces of state from the store.
    ```javascript
    const selectCount = (state) => state.count;
    ```

19. **Effects and Entities**:
    - Effects are used to manage side effects in ngrx applications.

20. **Concepts of Effects**:
    - An overview of ngrx effects.

21. **Our first @Effect**:
    - Implementing your first ngrx effect.

22. **Optimizing Data Structures with Entities**:
    - Using entities to optimize data storage in the store.

23. **Router State Composition**:
    - Managing router state in the ngrx store.

24. **Hooking up @ngrx/router-store**:
    - Integrating router state management with ngrx.

25. **Custom Router State Serializers**:
    - Customizing the serialization of router state.

26. **Router State and Entity Composition**:
    - Combining router state with entity state.

27. **Extending our State Tree**:
    - Expanding the ngrx state tree with additional features.

28. **Further Action Creators**:
    - Creating more action creators for various actions.

29. **Multiple Reducers**:
    - Using multiple reducers to manage different parts of the state.

30. **Further Effects**:
    - Implementing additional ngrx effects.

31. **Selector Composition**:
    - Composing selectors to retrieve complex data from the store.

32. **Mapping IDs to Entities**:
    - Mapping IDs to entities for efficient data access.

33. **Store Selectors and Async Pipe**:
    - Using store selectors in combination with the async pipe.

34. **Entity patterns, CRUD operations**:
    - Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities in the store.

35. **Creating, via Dispatch, Reducer and Effect**:
    - Creating entities using actions, reducers, and effects.

36. **Updating, via Dispatch, Reducer and Effect**:
    - Updating entities in the store via actions, reducers, and effects.

37. **Deleting, via Dispatch, Reducer and Effect**:
    - Deleting entities from the store via actions, reducers, and effects.

38. **Routing via Dispatch**:
    - Navigating in the application using dispatched actions.

39. **Router Actions and Effect**:
    - Handling router actions using ngrx effects.

40. **Multiple Actions in Effects, Router Actions**:
    - Managing multiple actions in ngrx effects, including router actions.
